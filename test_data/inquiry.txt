Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am interested in purchasing items from your shop and would like to confirm if I can use my bank's card for the transaction. Could you please clarify the following:

1. Is my bank card accepted as a payment method on your platform?
2. Are there any specific requirements or restrictions I should be aware of?
3. Can you provide a brief guide on how to complete a purchase using a card?

Your assistance will be greatly appreciated as Iâ€™m eager to proceed with my purchase.

Thank you for your time and support.
Kind regards,
Me
